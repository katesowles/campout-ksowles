<SiteHeader @headerTitle="List O' Campgrounds" />

<Sidebar @list={{this.model.list}} @sidebarHeader="Menu"/>

{{!-- NOTE: bring back when Add is a modal, figure out the data store so that I don't have to pass active detail data into the Add component! <CampgroundDetail @campground={{this.model.detail}} @join=", " /> --}}

{{!-- NOTE: The above solution is GROSS, I totally know this. BUT I can't seem to get the nested routing/outlet thingamajigger working. This is a research task for Future Kate. --}}

<CampgroundAdd @campground={{this.model.campground}} @headerTitle="Add New Campground" @nameLabel="Name" @cityLabel="City" @stateLabel="State" @buttonText="Submit" />

{{outlet}}
